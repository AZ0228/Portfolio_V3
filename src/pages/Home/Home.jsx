By crafting tools that enabled customer service representatives to share links seamlessly and quickly search for answers, I was able to increase FAQ page visits by 50%. This overhaul also dramatically reduced the time it took to resolve customer inquiries. Beyond that, I took on the challenge of optimizing the home page load time, reducing it by 60%. I did this by moving away from external libraries and developing a lightweight custom framework for the animated hero bannerâ€”ultimately delivering a smoother and more enjoyable user experience.",
